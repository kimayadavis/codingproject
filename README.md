# codingproject
This a a coding project I practiced I wanted to showcase. Through this project I had to analyze the original code in C of the program, then converted the C functions into arm assembly to run a program. 
Within this project I learned skills about debugging, bitbanding, and through converting from a highlevel language to a lower level one I full understand the functionality as well as the memory functions that are happening within a simple command in C.
